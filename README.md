# ðŸ“Š Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using a Regression model<img src='https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/3316/media/bulldozer.jpg' alt='bulldozer'>

The goal of this project is to predict the sale price of Blue Book's Bulldozers, with the data provided by [Kaggle Blue Book for Bulldozers Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).

[The fast.ai Machine Learning course](https://course18.fast.ai/ml) served as an inspiration for the techniques used.

### 1. Problem Definition

> How well is it possible to predict the future sale price of a product, given its characteristics and previous examples of the amount for which similar products were sold?

### 2. Data

Upon observation, we conclude that the [Blue Book dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) represents a time series problem, as it is historical sales data of bulldozers. There are three datasets:

1. **Train.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples up to 2011(close to 400,000 examples with 50+ different attributes, including `SalePrice` which is the **target variable**).
2. **Valid.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples from 1st January 2012 to 30th April 2012(close to 12,000 examples with the same attributes as **Train.csv**).
3. **Test.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples from 1st May 2012 to November 2012(close to 12,000 but missing the `SalePrice` attribute, as this is what we will be attempting to predict).

### 3. Evaluation

For this project, Kaggle has set the [evaluation metric to being Root Mean Squared Log Error(RMSLE)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation), which we will attempt to obtain its lowest possible value.

Our results will be compared to others on the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/leaderboard).

### 4. Features

For this dataset, Kaggle provides a data dictionary which contains information about the meaning of each attribute.
